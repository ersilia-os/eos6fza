    "Title": "Toxicity at clinical trial stage",
    "Description": "Using the Molecule Net dataset ClinTox, the authors trained a classification model to predict the likelihood of failure in clinical trials due to toxicity. The dataset has been built using FDA approved drugs (non-toxic) and a set of drugs that have failed at advanced clinical trial stages. This model has been trained using the GROVER transformer (see eos7w6n or grover-embedding for a detail of the molecular featurization step with GROVER).\n",
